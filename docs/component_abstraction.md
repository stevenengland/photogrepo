# Component abstraction

## Media source

* The `Media Source` is a piece of software that has access to media files. E.g. a software that is sitting on smartphones and cameras.

## Media Collector

## Media Repository

* The heart of the media thingi
* All about data consistency 

## Media xyz

* Stores media files as a flat hierarchy in the `Media Repository`.
    * Flat means in a single folder or max. in a chronological structure devided by years and so on.
    * There should be no further logic being applied when saving the files. Organization in albums etc. should be realized by the `Media Presenter` via the `Derived Virtual Media Repository`
